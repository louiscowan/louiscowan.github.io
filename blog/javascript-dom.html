        <h1>Javascript DOM</h1>
          <hr>
        <h2>Javascript and its relationship with HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>Javascript has a very intimate relationship with HTML and CSS. Some would say the were made for each other. In the current day and age, good websites must consist of three things. The information on the page and how it is layed out on the page. How the page looks, your colour palette and images. And finally the interactivity on your page. Emoji's bouncing around and nice clicking sounds when buttons are pressed. HTML, CSS and Javascript are the three core components on most web pages.

        <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
            <p>Control flow is the way the a computer reads through code. For example, you know those adventure/choose your own story books where you will have make a choice and go to the page of that choice. This is like control flow in coding. The computer will read through your code from left to right and down the page until it reaches a function for example that tells the computer to go somewhere else.</p>
          <br>
            <p>Loops are a way of iterating through things such as arrays. They will go through each thing in an array and do something to it, such as adding one to a number and then returning it to the array etc. An example of this could be chopping up a bag of mushrooms. You need to make a mushroom soup but for some reason you bought whole mushrooms instead of cut ones. The loop will be you grabbing each mushroom and the thing you will do to it is chop up the mushrooms. One by one you cut up a mushroom and put it on the board ready to be cooked.</p>

        <h2>The DOM</h2>
            <p>The document object model aka the DOM, is a pathway that allows you to link and control and change elements within your HTML and CSS with Javascript. An example of how you might interact with the DOM is by using document. followed by something like getElementById(). this allows you to grab an element such as a "< p >" tag and change the font size. </p>
