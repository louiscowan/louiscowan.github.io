                Myself and My Ego
            </h2>
                <p>
                    I have learned a lot about myself during core learning in Dev Academy foundations. I have learned that when I am struggling on a problem, I have the ablility to not give up for hours on end without getting very frustrated. This might not always be a good thing, but I think it shows that I have the ability to learn and attempt problems in new ways and also the ability to keep a level head and not give up.

            <h2>Values, Empathy and Self-Awareness in Programming</h2>
                <p>
                    As I have learned during foundations at bootcamp, EQ can be better then IQ a lot of the time. Values, empathy and self-awareness are crucial to becoming a good progammer. Being able to accept different values that people have or being able to empathise with someone on a personal level or maybe they are just having a hard time figuring out how a piece of code works, this can have a huge effect on how you work in a team which is crucial when working in a company. Also being self-aware can help you know when you are doing something wrong and maybe you should try improve on it, be it working with others better or just improving on yourself.

                What Has Surprised Me the Most During Core Learning
            </h2>
                <p>
                    The thing that has surprised me the most during core learning is how much EQ matters. I have always known that being able to get along with people is a good thing to do and I have been taught that from a very young age, but after reading about how companies can look for EQ or IQ was not what I was expecting.

            <h2>
                What was the most Challenging part of Core Learning
            </h2>
                <p>
                    The most challenging part of Core Learning was opening probably opening my mind to it as a whole. I am not the type of person who like to talk about emotions or have a super deep conversation, so opening myself up to it has not been the easiest. I know feel more open to it, but I am still not fully there.

            <h2>
                    Why are we Focusing on Core Learning So Much
            </h2>
                <p>
                    Core learning is very important in the business world. It helps with working in a team and can actually be looked at over things such as IQ. Dev Academy is a way to get the best experience for a tech job. This means that they will try to teach you the things that will make you successful during your career. This is why it is taught with so much emphasis.

            <h2>
                Was Core Learning a Waste of Time
            </h2>
                <p>
                    I don't think that the core learning was a waste of time, especially if it is as important as the internet says it is. I feel that I have done about 40 percent core learning and 60 percent coding and feel that the core learning has helped me learn to programme better any way. Just learning to not get frustrated when stuck on a problem can be a huge accomplishment when learning code as you get stuck all the time and you can never know everything.
