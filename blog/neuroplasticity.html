            <h2>How does knowing about the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h2>
                <p>It has been proven that just knowing about neuroplasticity can actually impact how you learn. Students who are told that your brain is not static, but a malleable thing, learn better than students who donâ€™t. They understand that not knowing something is not a bad thing, but rather a way to create stronger pathways and learn a new skill.</p>

            <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h2>
                <p>Instead of being frustrated and having the urge to give up on a problem, I can reassure myself that it is strengthening my understanding about what I am learning and giving up or not thinking that I can learn will hold me back a lot more. I can also practise, practise, practise.</p>

            <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
                <p>Some ways to increase your neuroplasticity are: exercising, eating healthy, and engaging in learning new things. This can be in the form of work, or something personal like learning an instrument or getting better at a video game.</p>
