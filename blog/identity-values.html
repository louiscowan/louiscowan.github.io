    <h2>Ethical situation</h2>
    <p> A situation where I have had to make an ethical decision was in my semi finals game of football. It was my last season of football playing for college and we were drawing 1-1. I ran down the field to the end of their half and got tackled. The ball went out for a throw in and the referee gave it to us. This was when I had to make an ethical decision as I was actually the last one to touch the ball, so it should really have been their throw in. I had to choose whether to not say anything and have a very good opportunity on goal or tell the referee that It was their throw in. I decided to tell the referee that I touched the ball last and it should really be their throw in. I have been taught my whole life that telling the truth, even when it doesn't work out for you, can be the best thing to do. I believe that both teams should tell the truth when it comes to things like this so that we may have a fair game. If I were in this situation again I would hope that I would do the same thing as I believe that it was still the right thing to do.</p>

      <h2>How the people around me inluence my values</h2>
    <p> I have been heavily influenced by the people around me, as I believe everyone most likely is. My families values have most likely been passed to me, as well as my friends. Although I do think that your friends have the same sort of values, otherwise it would be harder to be close with them.</p>

    <h2>My Strengths</h2>
    <p> My strengths are being able to work on comlplex problems and enjoy working and figuring out solutions with a group of people. I would hope that these strngths will support me through this course as I think there will be a lot of problem solving and group working.</p>
    <h2>One of my limitations</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> A limitation I have that may affect my learning at Dev Academy is that I can get frustrated when something doesn't work when I feel like it should. This can be a problem in coding as if you make any mistake such as a missing bracket etc, your code can not work. Luckily I have done some coding before Dev Academy and have been able to work around with this hinderance.</p>

    <h2>An example of working with others, with resistence</h2>
    <p>A time I was trying to work productively with others was in a zoom tutorial at University. We were doing a group exercise where we had to work out where people lived on a street and what they drove. Anyway, we were put into groups of around five and we didn't have any supervision so no one could be bothered doing the task and just sat their muted. I tried to start on it and hope that people would follow along, but I ended up just finishing it by myself. If I were to try do it again I think that I would try to lead the group a bit more. Maybe give people specific tasks to involve them more</p>
