    <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>My Long Term Goal</h2>
    <p>My long term goal is to be a succesful software developer. I want to be able to proudly say that "I built that", on a big project. I don't know whether I want to stay in the coding side of things or go towards the business side at this stage, but I assume it will come with time.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
    <p>One strength that I have is the ability to be able to learn and be good at just about everything I put my mind to. This, however goes into one of my limitations with learning. I am not able to put enough energy in to things that I am not really interseted in. This can mean that If I am told to learn something that I can't be very bothered about learning I can find it hard to give myself the energy to do it.</p>

    <h2>What skills do I want to develop at Dev Academy</h2>
    <p>A skill that I would really like to improve at Dev Academy, and a big reason I wanted to get into Dev Academy, is the ability to work and have genuine conversation with people I do not know and possibly don't get along with very well.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Commitments</h2>
    <p>I will commit to always being happy, making jokes and having fun etc, so that I may rise peoples spirits. I will work with whomever and treat them the respect they deserve. I will look to family for support as they probably want to see me get through this more than I do and other Dev Academy attendees so that they may help me through it as I will do for them.</p>

    <h2>What I expect from the facilitation team is to give us the resources needed to succeed and to push the group forward as a whole.</h2>
